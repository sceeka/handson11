# AWS Core Services Hands-on (ITCS 6190 / 8190 - Cloud Computing for Data Analysis)

## 📘 Overview
This hands-on project explores the **core AWS services**—**Amazon S3**, **AWS Glue**, **Amazon CloudWatch**, and **Amazon Athena**—to perform data analysis on an e-commerce dataset.  
The main goal is to create an end-to-end data workflow that loads raw data into AWS, processes it, and queries it for insights.

---

## 🧩 Services Used
- **Amazon S3** – Stores raw and processed data.
- **AWS Glue** – Crawls and catalogs the dataset into a structured schema.
- **AWS CloudWatch** – Monitors the Glue crawler execution and job logs.
- **Amazon Athena** – Queries the cataloged data directly from S3 using SQL.

---

## 🗂️ Dataset
**Source:** [Unlock Profits with E-Commerce Sales Data (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/unlock-profits-with-e-commerce-sales-data)

The dataset includes transaction-level sales data for various products, categories, and regions—ideal for analytics on profitability, growth, and sales patterns.

---

## ⚙️ Workflow Steps

### 1. **Amazon S3 Configuration**
- Create two buckets:
  - `raw-data-bucket`: To store the uploaded CSV dataset.
  - `processed-data-bucket`: To store the transformed or queried data.
- Upload the CSV dataset to the raw data bucket.

### 2. **IAM Role Setup**
- Create an **IAM Role** with the following permissions:
  - `AmazonS3FullAccess`
  - `AWSGlueServiceRole`
- Assign this role to the Glue crawler to allow access to S3 and Glue services.

### 3. **AWS Glue Crawler**
- Create a **Glue Crawler**:
  - Data source: `raw-data-bucket`
  - Target: AWS Glue Data Catalog
  - IAM role: The role created in the previous step.
- Run the crawler to automatically detect schema and create a table in the Glue Data Catalog.

### 4. **Monitoring with CloudWatch**
- Open **Amazon CloudWatch** to:
  - Monitor the Glue crawler execution logs.
  - Check for any errors or warnings during data crawling.

### 5. **Athena Query Execution**
- In **Amazon Athena**, select the database created by the Glue crawler.
- Run SQL queries on the table to analyze sales performance and profitability.

## 🧮 Queries Executed in Athena

Each query includes a `LIMIT 10` condition to restrict the output for review.

1. **Cumulative Sales Over Time (Specific Year)**  
   Calculate the running total of sales per day for a given year.

2. **Geographic "Hotspot" Analysis for Unprofitable Products**  
   Identify states with the highest negative profits.

3. **Impact of Discounts on Profitability by Sub-Category**  
   Analyze how discount levels affect profit margins per sub-category.

4. **Top 3 Most Profitable Products Within Each Category**  
   Rank products by total profit using a window function.

5. **Monthly Sales and Profit Growth Analysis**  
   Compute monthly totals and growth rates for sales and profits.
